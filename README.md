One Liter Of Gasoline
=====================

This project is a data visualization of How much gasoline 20 euros will buy.

The data source is from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jun/12/city-cost-of-living-2012-tokyo" target="_blank">Worldwide Cost of Living Survey 2012</a> on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog" target="_blank">Guardian's Datablog</a>. Among categories, I am interested in exploring more about gasoline because we hear economic news about U.S. dollar index, price of gold and oil everyday.

There are three types of visualization: bubble, fuel gauge and bar. The bubble chart enables to read easily with point color and size of circles. The fuel gauge chart helps understanding better with a familiar interface in daily life. The bar chart is very traditional in terms of data comparison but I play with gradient color and geographical regions.
